# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Overview

This challenge is our first JavaScript challenge. We were tasked with creating code for analysing the financial records of a company. The financial dataset was provided in the index.js file.

I decided early on that I wanted to split this in to function. I feel this helps read and understand the code better, and if you do come across errors then you just need to debug that particular function. I understand that I could have probably consolidated the functions, but I understand the concepts better split out like this. The coding part wasn’t particularly challenging, the more difficult part for me was deciphering the maths, additionally I didn’t think the instruction were particularly clear, but I got there in the end, but not sure I would have without Dan's interpretation of the results.

Added a nice little Merry Christmas index.html, for some festive spirt.


## Instructions

Follow this link to view the website [Console-Finances](https://computastar.github.io/Console-Finances/).

The task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset.

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

It will need to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.

(Total/Number of months)

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When you open the code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 25
Total: $2561231
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
Your final code should print the analysis to the console.
