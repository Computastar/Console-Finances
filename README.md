# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Overview

This challenge is our first JavaScript challenge. We were tasked with creating code for analysing the financial records of a company. The financial dataset was provided in the index.js file.

I decided early on that I wanted to split this in to function. I feel this helps read and understand the code better, and if you do come across errors then you just need to debug that particular function. I understand that I could have probably consolidated the functions, but I understand the concepts better split out like this. The coding part wasn’t particularly challenging, the more difficult part for me was deciphering the maths, additionally I didn’t think the instruction were particularly clear, but I got there in the end, but not sure I would have without Dan's interpretation of the results.

Added a nice little Merry Christmas index.html, for some festive spirt.
